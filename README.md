  <h4> Get Followers On Instagram Using Termux Only ! </h4>

### What is InstaSub?
[**InstaSub**](https://github.com/RozhakXD/InstaSub) is a script used to get followers for free using Termux and the [Traodoisub](https:www/traodoisub.com) website. Before that you have to carry out a mission to get Coins and then exchange them for Instagram followers.

### Termux command
First you must have the [Termux](https://f-droid.org/repo/com.termux_118.apk) application to run this tool and for how to use it can be seen on [**Youtube**](https://www.youtube.com/rozhakid). Then you enter some basic commands below!
```
$ apt update -y && apt upgrade -y
$ pkg install git python-pip
$ git clone https://github.com/RozhakXD/InstaSub
$ cd "InstaSub"
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python Run.py
```

```
$ cd "$HOME/InstaSub" && git pul
$ python Run.py
```

### Why did my account get spammed?
Maybe you are using a new account or the delay used is too short. After 24 hours your account will return to normal or no longer be spammed. I have several solutions to deal with accounts getting spammed while on missions.

**Solution :**
- Using Cookies randomly to be more secure.
- Using a delay above 60 seconds.
- Do not use the newly created account.

### When will the coins arrive at Traodoisub?
After completing the mission, your coins will be checked for *1 to 7* days before arriving in your Traodoisub account. Make sure your account is unlocked and don't unfollow accounts that have previously been followed so that the coins can successfully arrive at the Traodoisub account. If the account is dead you will not get any coins!

### When will followers come in?
If you have exchanged coins for followers you will get followers slowly according to the number of users on the Traodoisub website. This happens because it is influenced by the number of website users and in order to reduce spam on our Instagram account.

### Instagram account terms
There is a requirement to add an Instagram account to the Traodoisub configuration. I do not recommend that you use the main account to carry out missions or login in scripts.

**Requirement :**
- Having a name on the account is only Vietnamese, for example : *Nguyễn Văn*
- The account is not in private mode.
- Have a profile photo.
- Not a newly created account.
- Have 3 posts in the account.

If it meets the requirements but cannot be added to the configuration, then the account is not supported or the website is having an error when adding to the configuration.

print("Good luck hope it works!")
